# Creality Sprite Pro 40mm Fan Duct
I broke my Sprite Pro hot end cooling fan, so I made a model so it fits a 40mm fan I had instead of a 30mm fan. I don't use this anymore since I have a new 30mm fan and board now, but it worked well for a while. Here's the model if anyone else needs it. I used heat inserts to fit the screws for the board, fan and BLTouch.
